## High Level Design

![hld](images/highleveldesign.png)

Based on highly available multi-tenant storage, Furo LADS supports a robust and proactive approach to detecting anomalies during the login process. When login-related context information is transmitted through the Rest API, the system analyzes it and returns the detected pattern along with the AI anomaly score. We comprehensively analyze login context information using various AI models and pattern analysis methods.
