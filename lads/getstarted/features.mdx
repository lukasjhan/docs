## Cloud-Based Convenience

The Furo LADS offers the convenience of a cloud-based solution, making it easy to integrate into your existing infrastructure. With well-documented APIs and clear integration guidelines, developers can quickly and seamlessly incorporate the anomaly detection capabilities into their applications or platforms. The cloud-based nature of the solution also provides scalability, allowing it to handle varying levels of traffic and adapt to the changing needs of your system.

## AI-Based Anomaly Evaluation

The system utilizes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to evaluate login activities and identify anomalies. By analyzing various parameters such as login behavior, geolocation, device information, and historical patterns, the AI algorithms can accurately distinguish between legitimate and suspicious login attempts. This intelligent anomaly evaluation ensures that potential threats are detected with high precision, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Detection Rules Constantly Updated

To stay ahead of evolving threats, the Furo LADS continuously updates its detection rules. The system leverages threat intelligence sources and machine learning models to adapt to new attack vectors, emerging patterns, and evolving tactics employed by malicious actors. This proactive approach ensures that the system remains effective in detecting and preventing the latest login anomalies, providing enhanced security for your application or platform.

## Credential Stuffing Detection (Public Information)

Credential stuffing is a common attack method where attackers use stolen login credentials from one platform to gain unauthorized access to other platforms. The Furo LADS includes specific detection mechanisms to identify potential credential stuffing attacks. By comparing the login credentials used against known public information breaches, the system can flag suspicious login attempts associated with compromised credentials, helping prevent unauthorized access and account takeover incidents.

## User Notification (Email, SMS)

The Furo LADS offers user notification capabilities to ensure that users are promptly informed about potential security incidents. Through email and SMS notifications, the system can alert users when suspicious login activities are detected on their accounts. These notifications empower users to take immediate action, such as changing their passwords or reporting unauthorized access attempts, thereby enhancing user engagement and trust in the security measures implemented.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Furo LADS includes built-in support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an additional layer of security that significantly enhances the login process. MFA adds an extra step beyond the traditional username and password combination, requiring users to provide additional authentication factors to verify their identity.

## Device Fingerprint

The Furo LADS includes device fingerprinting capabilities to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. Device fingerprinting involves collecting and analyzing unique attributes and characteristics of the device used for login, such as browser type, operating system, screen resolution, installed plugins, and more. By comparing device fingerprints with known patterns and historical data, the system can identify suspicious login activities associated with unfamiliar or manipulated devices. Device fingerprinting adds an additional layer of security by detecting potential account takeover attempts or fraudulent login activities originating from unrecognized devices.

## Bot and Brute Force Attack Detection

The Furo LADS employs advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate bot-based attacks and brute force login attempts. Bots are automated scripts or programs that attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying various combinations of usernames and passwords. By analyzing login patterns, frequency, and failed login attempts, the system can identify suspicious login activities indicative of bot-driven or brute force attacks. Upon detection, the system can take appropriate actions, such as blocking or throttling login attempts from suspicious sources, thereby preventing unauthorized access and protecting user accounts from malicious activities.
