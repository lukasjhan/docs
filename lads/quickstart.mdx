## Getting Started with Furo LADS Docs

Welcome to the Furo LADS documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure and secure your login with the advanced features Furo LADS offers.

### 1. Configuring Furo LADS Project

We provide an API to secure your login. You can manage its configuration in Our [Dashboard](https://lads.furo.one/home).

<Accordion title="Create a LADS Project">
  To create your first project, All you need to do is to click ["Get
  started"](https://lads.furo.one/home) button.

<Accordion title="Check APP ID & API Key">
  We use Basic Auth to authenticate your requests. You can find your APP ID and
  API Key in dashboard. ![apikey](/images/apikey.png)
</Accordion>

### 2. Secure Your Login

<Accordion title="Add API request in your server">
  You can find the API documentation [here](/api-reference/anomalydetection).
  You can use any languages to use our services.

Don't forget to add your **APP ID** and **API Key** in your request as **Basic Auth**.

below is an example of using our API in NodeJS.

```js
const login = app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const user = database.getUser(req.userId, req.password);

  try {
	  const { score, type } = await axios.post("https://lads-api.furo.one/lads",
        {
            uid: user.id,
            ip: req.ip,
            userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
            type: "login",
            status: "success"
          },
          {
            auth: {
              username: "APP_ID",
              password: "API_KEY"
            },
            timeout: 2000,
          }
      );

	  // do actions..
	  if (score >= 70) {
		  // verify email
	  } else if (score >= 50) {
		  // send alert email
	  }
  } catch {
	  //...
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000.');
});
```

</Accordion>
